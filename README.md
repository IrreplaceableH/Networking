Catnork Technologist Ltd - Secure Internal Network Design (Packet Tracer Project)
Project Overview: This Packet Tracer-based simulation showcases a secure internal network architecture tailored for Catnork Technologist Ltd, a midsize technology firm.
The design emphasizes robust segmentation, access control, and threat mitigation across departments.

1.	VLAN Implementation: Logical separation for departments like HR, Finance, IT, and Admin to enhance security and minimize broadcast traffic.
2.	Firewall & ACLs: Configured to regulate inbound and outbound traffic, enforcing rules between internal zones and restricting unauthorized access.
3.	Router & Switch Configuration: Layer 2 and 3 devices optimally set up for internal routing, redundancy, and traffic prioritization.
4.	Simulated Endpoints: PCs, servers, and administrative devices assigned with static IPs and mapped to relevant subnets.
5.	Security Practices: Integration of secure protocols (e.g., SSH), basic intrusion prevention settings, and encrypted data transfers within the internal network.

Purpose:
To demonstrate a scalable and secure network model that aligns with best practices in cybersecurity and internal resource management, suitable for real-world deployment in a business setting.
